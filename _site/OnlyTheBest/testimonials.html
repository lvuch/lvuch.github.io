I had Alisa alter my ‘off the rack’ wedding gown which was already 4 sizes too large for me. I was hesitant about whether or not this could be done, but not only did she make it happen - she was awesome to work with! She made it really easy for me - arranging fittings around my busy schedule. She did a fantastic job and the dress fit as if it was custom made!

I was constantly being told that the dress I wanted didn’t come in my size, or there was not enough time to order it for my wedding. I was running out of time and almost in tears when I met Alisa. She asked me to describe my dream dress while she sketched out my vision. I was excited - she made my dress exactly as I described it. I was so pleased, I invited her to the wedding and sent my coordinator to bring her back to take a picture with me before the wedding started! Thanks Alisa!
